<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    The main architect of the city wants to build a new highest building.<br>
    You have to help him find the current highest building in the city.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img  title="The highest building" src="{{MEDIA}}example.jpg" alt="example" style="max-height: 283px"/>
</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Heights of the buildings as a 2D-array.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of the highest building and height of it as a list of integers (Important: in this task the building numbers starts from "1", not from "0") 
</p>


<!-- Put some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
<p>
<strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
{% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}
<pre class="brush: javascript">highestBuilding([[0, 0, 1, 0],
                 [1, 0, 1, 1],
                 [1, 1, 1, 1],
                 [1, 1, 1, 1]]) == [3, 4] 
// building №3 is the highest, with height = 4
</pre>
{% else %}
<pre class="brush: python">highest_building([[0, 0, 1, 0],
                  [1, 0, 1, 1],
                  [1, 1, 1, 1],
                  [1, 1, 1, 1]]) == [3, 4]
# building №3 is the highest, with height = 4
</pre>
{% endif %}

<!-- Here you can explain how it can be used in development and what is usage of this. -->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Every true programmer should know how to work with the 2D-arrays.
</p>

<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p><strong>Precondition</strong>:<br>
    array width <= 10<br>
    array height <= 10<br>
    There is only 1 highest building in each array
</p>
